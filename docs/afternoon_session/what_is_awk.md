# What is AWK

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - to understand what AWK is
    - to understand the difference between AWK and Awk and `awk`
    - to learn when to use AWK

???- question "For teachers"

    Teaching goals are:

    - The learners get an idea what AWK is
    - The learners connect AWK with something they know
    - The learners know the difference between the words AWK, Awk and `awk`

    Lesson plan:

    * 5 mins: prior knowledge
    * 5 mins: presentation
    * 15 mins: challenge
    * 5 mins: feedback

## Overview

In this session, we get a first idea what AWK is.

AWK is a interpreted programming language, that processes tabular data.

## Exercises

See the exercise procedure [here](../misc/exercise_procedure.md).

### Exercise 1: what is AWK?

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - to understand what AWK is
    - to understand the difference between AWK and Awk and `awk`

*Scan* (i.e. get an idea of its content, **not** read in detail) the page:

- [The Wikipedia 'AWK' page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK)

Search the page to determine which of these statements below is true, 
and why they are true/false:

- (1) AWK is a programming language
- (2) AWK is an interpreted programming language
- (3) AWK is a compiled programming language
- (4) AWK works on text files
- (5) AWK works on images
- (6) AWK works on `.docx` files
- (7) The programming language AWK can be spelled as Awk too
- (8) The programming language AWK can be spelled as `awk` too

???- info "Solutions"

    - (1) AWK is a programming language

    Yes.

    - (2) AWK is an interpreted programming language

    Yes. For example, `gawk` is an AWK interpreter.

    - (3) AWK is a compiled programming language

    No.

    However, in the past it was! For example, `awka` and `tawk` were AWK compilers.
    Due to this, most people will say AWK is not a compiled programming language.

    C, C++, Fortran, Go and Rust are better examples of a compiled programming language.

    - (4) AWK works on text files

    Yes.

    - (5) AWK works on images

    No: AWK works best on text files. 

    However, some image files, such as SVG, are text-based. 
    This means that AWK *can* work on those images.

    - (6) AWK works on `.docx` files

    No: AWK works best on text files. A `.docx` files is zipped, 
    hence has binary data

    - (7) The programming language AWK can be spelled as Awk too

    No. Where 'AWK' means the programming language, 'Awk'
    is used in a context with something else. 
    For example, 'GNU Awk' is the name for the GNU implementation of AWK.
    As GNU Awk is the most used AWK interpreter, it is sometimes called
    Awk (i.e. without 'GNU' in front of it). In that case too, 'Awk' is the
    name of the interpreter, not the language.

    - (8) The programming language AWK can be spelled as `awk` too

    No. Where 'AWK' means the programming language, `awk`
    is the name of a program called `awk`, 
    which is an AWK interpreter
